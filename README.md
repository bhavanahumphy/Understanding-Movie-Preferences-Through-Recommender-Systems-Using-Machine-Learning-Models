# Understanding-Movie-Preferences-Through-Recommender-Systems-Using-Machine-Learning-Models

# Abstract
This project explores user movie preferences and rating behaviors using the MovieLens dataset. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning, the study identifies key patterns in genre preferences, temporal rating trends, and tag usage. Two predictive models—Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor—were developed to forecast movie ratings. While both models performed well, Random Forest showed slightly better predictive accuracy. Key findings highlight user preferences for genres like Film-Noir, Drama, and Sci-Fi, and the temporal consistency of ratings. This research demonstrates the potential of machine learning to enhance recommender systems, paving the way for more personalized and engaging digital entertainment experiences. Future improvements include advanced ensemble methods, collaborative filtering, and deep learning for more accurate recommendations.
